    <h2>Assignment 1 (10/12/20)</h2>
    <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~lichel/cs290/assignment-1/index.html">index.html</a>
    <p>
      I thought that the biggest challenge was figuring out how to display an image on the idex.html file.
      I tried to upload an image from my local drive but the image would never load properly.
      I went to the TA office hours and a TA suggested that I should use an image from my Google Drive instead and it fixed the problem.
      I learned a lot about how to format a website and how to publish my html files.
      In order for me to complete this project I used the lecture notes and I also did a lot of Googling to find solutions to any problems I had.

      I mainly just had trouble trying to figure out how to start the CSS file. 
      I wasn't sure how to control the features in the HTML file so I had to Google solutions and read the lecture notes to figure everything out. 
      I learned a lot about CSS programming, I've never used it before and it's a lot different than objective and functional programming so this was a fun experience. 
      I did notice that CSS programming is somewhat similar to JavaFX programming since they both involve GUI features. 
      The TAs, lecture notes, TutorialPoint, GeeksforGeeks, and Google were very helpful resources for this assignment.
      I mainly had to Google how to position GUI items and certain button features.

    <h2>Assignment 3 (11/16/20)</h2>

    <p>
      The biggest problem I had was figuring out how to start the Javascript file because I've never coded in Javascript before.
      I learned a lot about programming in Javascript and using Javascript to manipulate website features coded in HTML.
      I thought that the lecture notes, TA, TutorialPoint, GeeksforGeeks, StackOverflow, and Google were very helpful resources for this assignment.
      I had to Google how to delete and re-add deleted objects for the re-filtering extra credit section. I also had to do a lot of Googling on the Javascript syntax.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Assignment 5 (12/02/20)</h2>
    <p>
      I thought that understanding how to use handle bars and modifying the server.js file was the most challenging part about the assignment. I had to go to the TA office hours and go over the lecture notes to figure out how to use them.
      I learned a lot about using templates to design an HTML page.
      I mainly used the lecture notes to complete the assignment and when I had some questions I had them answered by the TAs.
      I had to look up what some error messages meant when using the npm command and I also had to look up the right syntax for the handlebars.
