    <p>The most unique experience I've had was that I once almost met Phil Knight. 
        I used to be a guide volunteer for OHSU, and I was assigned a task to help an elderly woman to her car.
        Right when I got back inside the hospital, somebody told me that Phil Knight just left.
        Turns out he went to the glasses store in the hospital to buy a new pair of glasses.
        I really wanted to meet him so that I could've gave him a bunch of awesome new shoe designs.
